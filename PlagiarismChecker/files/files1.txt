My experiences in industry have taught me about the complexities of the real world, 
how cost and schedules are critical, the need to pay attention to competition, and the importance of 
multi disciplinary teams. 

I learned that the successful product has to appeal to customers, and the criteria they use to determine what 
to purchase may have surprisingly little overlap with the aspects that are important during usage. 

The best products do not always succeed. 

Brilliant new technologies might take decades to become accepted. 

To understand products, it is not enough to understand design or technology: it is critical to understand business.
