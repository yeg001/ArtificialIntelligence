Finally, my exposure to industry taught me much about the way 
products actually get deployed, so I added considerable information about the impact of budgets, schedules, and competitive 
pressures. When I wrote the original book, I was an academic researcher. 

Today, I have been an industry executive,a consultant to numerous companies, and a board 
member of companies. I had to include my learnings from these 
experiences.
